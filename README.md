## Amazon Product Similarity Analysis

### Janielle Jackson INST414

This project analyzes Amazon best-selling software products to identify and rank items that are most similar to selected query products. Using features such as product price, star rating, and number of reviews, the script applies cosine similarity to compare products and generate the top 10 most similar results for each query. The goal is to explore how different types of software (e.g., tax tools, productivity suites, and antivirus programs) relate to one another based on customer engagement and product characteristics.
